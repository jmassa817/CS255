# CS255
Coursework for CS255 system analysis and design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Our client, DriverPass,  realized that many people were failing their drivers test so they wanted to implement a system where customers could view online course materials and take practice tests online.  These tests and courses would be in compliance with current DMV regulations.  They wanted their customers to be able to view, purchase and schedule in person training reservations both online, in person and over the telephone.  They also wanted customers to make changes to their account information on their own via the web, over the phone or in person. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel that i interpreted the clients needs thoroughly and created a plan that addressed all of their requirements and allowed for future expansion.  I was able to successfully translate the technical aspects of our design in plain english for the non technical stakeholders.  

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Given enough time,  I would revise the Class diagram since this is the main diagram that our programmers will refer to when creating the application.  I feel it was a little light and some additional classes may be needed for successful implementation.  Also I did not include any methods which will be necesary before it can be handed off to the developers.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Whenever you are working with a client,  it is imperative to first understant what they expect the system to do before suggesting what you "think" it should do.  By listening to the client they were very clear what they wanted the system to do,  but also open to suggestions that would improve upon the design and improve their business functions.  Ultimately the system needs to meet their needs first,  anything else could be beneficial but only if it enhances their core business functions. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I personally always start with the underlying database.  Once I have a plan for how the data is to be organized and how data will be related with each other,  then I can begin to design the forms and code that will make storing and retrieving the data the most efficient.  Next I focus on how a user will view and search for existing data,  and I design forms that make this process clear and straightforward.  I focus on layout, function buttons and visuals.  I'll work on navigation and menu options next.  User access comes next and lastly security and maintenance.  Once complete I will work on documentation and a training regimine.  Once finished, I would create a test environment,  basically a copy of the system that I can test new features on which can be presented to the client in future updates.
